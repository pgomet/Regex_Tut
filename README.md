# Regex Tutorial

A collection of patterns known as a regular expression can be used to examine character combinations in strings. In this following lesson, I'll describe the various elements of the email validation regular expression (regex).

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll look at a regex that may be applied to validate an email. Please refer to the regex below.

* `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

You could find that the regex resembles an ordinary email address if you look at it carefully. See the differences below.

* `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` + `@` + `([\da-z\.-]+)` + `\.([a-z\.]{2,6})`
* `bob (username)` + `@` + `gmail (server name)` + `.com (top-level domain)`

Let's examine the meanings of each character now that we can notice the commonalities.
